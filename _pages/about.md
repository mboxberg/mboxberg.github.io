I am a geophysicist interested in icy moon exploration and wave propagation phenomena. This includes numerical modelling of (seismic) wave propagation in porous media, computational seismology, geophysical inverse problems like full waveform inversion and traveltime tomography, as well as trajectory models of ice melting probes.

Currently, I am working at the RWTH Aachen University and I am the deputy head of the Geophysical Imaging and Monitoring Teaching and Research Unit and coordinator of a BGE-sponsored project related to nuclear waste repositories.

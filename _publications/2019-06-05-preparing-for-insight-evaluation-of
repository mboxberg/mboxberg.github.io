excerpt: 'In December 2018, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Interior exploration using Seismic 
Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport (InSight) mission deployed a seismometer on the surface of Mars. In 
preparation for the data analysis, in July 2017, the marsquake service initiated a blind test in which participants were 
asked to detect and characterize seismicity embedded in a one Earth year long synthetic data set of continuous waveforms.

In December 2018, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Interior exploration using Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport (InSight) mission deployed a seismometer on the surface of Mars. In preparation for the data analysis, in July 2017, the marsquake service initiated a blind test in which participants were asked to detect and characterize seismicity embedded in a one Earth year long synthetic data set of continuous waveforms. Synthetic data were computed for a single station, mimicking the streams that will be available from InSight as well as the expected tectonic and impact seismicity, and noise conditions on Mars (Clinton et al., 2017). In total, 84 teams from 20 countries registered for the blind test and 11 of them submitted their results in early 2018. The collection of documentations, methods, ideas, and codes submitted by the participants exceeds 100 pages. The teams proposed well established as well as novel methods to tackle the challenging target of building a global seismicity catalog using a single station. This article summarizes the performance of the teams and highlights the most successful contributions.
